This causes a lot of void function that simply mutate data instead if create function that take in data and return something new.\\nDeleting items from Observables. Observables are a bit mysterious, they are lightning fast array like data structures that can be updated repeatedly without from any where in the app. A bit like quantum entanglement. But they are unindexed and while you can add to them and magically update them they lack the ability to remove an item from the list. This last let people to do things with like cache the data in a service which they mutate and return as an Observable.\\nFinding current answers to questionsâ€¦ good luck. This is caused by a couple of things. A.) They change up so much from iteration to iteration and everything was a breaking change 2.) The name is basically the same as angular 1 while the frameworks couldnâ€™t be more different. III.) The damn thing was in beta longer then its been out and 3 months after v2.0â€¦ hereâ€™s v4.0!!!

By extracting all your app state and data into a store, it makes writing your Angular a breeze. When we take that beautiful immutable idea and add in some functional concepts our code becomes neat and organized and easy to test.</p>\\n<p>Before we go further, here are some simple rules I follow.</p>\\n<p>Rule 1:\\nExternalize callbacks. Always call a functions for success/error of a promise or subscription, never do the function inside the .subscribe() or .then() like you will see in EVERY EXAMPLE</p>\\n<p>** Why **\\nDoing this makes unit tests easierâ€¦ much easier. Now, we donâ€™t have to mock the return for .getData() or force it to resolve or anything. All we care about is that .getData was called. We can test returning anything we want in the setData() function. This also means we can create a test single object for each service that can be reused in all our specs.</p>\\n<p>Rule 2:\\nDonâ€™t do things the TypeScript way. I would say just donâ€™t use typescript but if you thought finding answers to questions was hard before, try finding answers in ES6. Write your TypeScript as if it was Javascript. Forget about creating types and models.</p>\\n<p>** Why **\\nSure it makes your code safer but it certainly doesnâ€™t make it cleaner. It also keeps your code closer to javascript so in 1â€“4 years when something better comes along (cough Vue, cough) You can reuse as much code as possible without the need to convert it from TypeScript to JavaScript. I think readability and reusability outweighs types safe pre transpiled code.</p>\\n<p>Rule 3:\\nAlways try to be declarative. Use .map() .filter() .reduce() ectâ€¦ instead of things like complex for loops. Even using a library like Ramda or Lodash.</p>\\n<p>** Why **\\nDeclarative code abstracts the logic from your code, and instead makes code more descriptive and focuses on what the code is doing an less on how code is doing it.</p>\\n<p>Whatâ€™ Nextâ€¦\\nI still donâ€™t see how this is doing Angular the React wayâ€¦</p>\\n<p>Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll feed you baby bird.
