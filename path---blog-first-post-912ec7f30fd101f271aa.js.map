Always call a functions for success/error of a promise or subscription, never do the function inside the .subscribe() or .then() like you will see in EVERY EXAMPLE</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nDoing this makes unit tests easier… much easier. Now, we don’t have to mock the return for .getData() or force it to resolve or anything. All we care about is that .getData was called. We can test returning anything we want in the setData() function. This also means we can create a test single object for each service that can be reused in all our specs.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>data<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>setData<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">setData</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h4>Rule 2:</h4>\\n<p>Don’t do things the TypeScript way.

Use .map() .filter() .reduce() ect… instead of things like complex for loops. Even using a library like Ramda or Lodash.</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nDeclarative code abstracts the logic from your code, and instead makes code more descriptive and focuses on what the code is doing an less on how code is doing it.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">double</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> results <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">for</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span> arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>length<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    results<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">push</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>i<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> results\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do This</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">double</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> arr <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">map</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>item <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> item <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Seriously, thats it! ;)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>What’ Next…</h2>\\n<p>I still don’t see how this is doing Angular the React way…</p>\\n<p>Don’t worry, I’ll feed you baby bird.
