The core of the application is Gatsby, a static site generator built on React, with Bulma as the CSS framework.</p>\\n<p>It took me about <strong>5 days</strong>, including learning Gatsby, to get the site \\\"framed out\\\" and write the first post. Here are the steps in my learning process:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Learn Gatsby</strong>\\nFirst I need to do some tutorials, so my friend sent me a link to some YouTube videos he used to learn Gatsby.\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE\\\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I later realized he was doing three of the guides on the Gatsby website. Never the less, his training worked, and I was rocking and rolling.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li><strong>Setup a simple blog from .md files</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/\\\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In this step, I followed along with the YouTube video series to get the pages in place. It took awhile to understand how the create pages stuff work on the gatsby-nodes file.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li><strong>Add in Bulma</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/\\\">https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I recently found Bulma while reading article about JavaScript 2017 Rising Stars <a href=\\\"https://risingstars.js.org/2017/en/#section-css-in-js\\\">https://risingstars.js.org/2017/en/#section-css-in-js</a></p>\\n<p>Since I hate bootstrap because EVERYONE uses it, I decided to give it a try, and so far I love it. I also LOVE Google Material but its starting to get a bit overused as well, plus its a bit too... fun... for the look I was going for.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li><strong>Navigation</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/\\\">https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>React makes things easy, try putting Bumla in Angular... good luck.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li><strong>Setup Medium Feed</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-medium/\\\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-medium/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This step was a real headache. The current medium plugin does not work for users, only publications. I had to change three lines of code and copy it into my gatsby-node.js file to get it to work.</p>\\n<p>The guy that sits next to me at work has created a pull request to fix the plugin. I was going to but he wanted to do it, and I wanted to work on this.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"6\\\">\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Deploy to Github Pages</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/\\\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Setup Custom URL for Github Pages</strong>\\nJust add the plug and point it to your repo.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>For me my set up is weird. I use Bitbucket for all my private repos, plus I cannot push to Github at work. So I have to do a bunch of push pull push pull.</p>\\n<p>Also, if you are using Source Tree like me instead of Github Desktop, you will have to remove 2 Factor Auth from Github -_-</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"8\\\">\\n<li><strong>Style Clean Up</strong>\\nI still haven't figured this out completely. Every time I push to gh-pages branch it resets my Custom Domain in the repo settings and I have to add aaronklaser.com back in. I tried the CNAME but that does not help.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Also, if you are using a custom domain, do not include the prefix in your gatsby-config.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"9\\\">\\n<li><strong>Fix Mobile Nav</strong>\\nYou will need to add your own Javascript to make this work.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>state <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\tisActive<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token boolean\\\">false</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">toggleNav</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">setState</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>prevState <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t\\tisActive<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>prevState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>isActive\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">className</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>button navbar-burger<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">onClick</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>{this.toggleNav}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">className</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>{</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">this.state.isActive</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">?</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">'navbar-menu</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">is-active'</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">'navbar-menu'}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<ol start=\\\"10\\\">\\n<li><strong>Create this post</strong>\\nA simple outline for now.

Lets see where the internet takes us. But let me very up front about something now…</p>\\n<p><strong>I AM NOT A WRITER</strong> … nor can my brain keep up with my fingers when I type, so this will be FULL of grammar errors and run on sentences. I know, I get it. I will try to do my best proof reading but I can’t promise anything. My tip to you is to just read everything with a Russian accent (which I don’t have) but that usually making things entertaining. Enjoy!</p>\\n<h2>Chapter One</h2>\\n<p>I have been doing Angular development for over 4 years and for the last 2 years I have been Angular 2/4/5/whatever (I will refer to it as Angular). But about a year ago I started to get into functional programming, and let me tell you, its changed my life about as much as finding Angular 1. But I learned quickly Angular, with its deeply ingrained object oriented designed, made doing things functional… well… difficult. Especially if you wanted to adhere to strict immutability. That’s when decided to look into the library everybody was raving about being the greatest think ever written… React!</p>\\n<p>At first, I thought this was the answer to all my problems, the solution to all my complaints. But I quickly realized that while yes it did address a lot of my complaints, it had its own set of equally frustrating issues. I built a few simple web pages, made an app using React Native, but at the end of the it found myself just as frustrated with React as I did with Angular. But I was determined because, and still feel this way, React is the better framework.</p>\\n<h3>The Problem(s)</h3>\\n<p>My top 3 of each but not limited to</p>\\n<h4>React:</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>SO MANY OPTIONS… seriously… There are so many libraries to choose\\nfrom I would spend time more looking at libraries then I would\\nbuilding.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Things get dirty fast, every tiny little thing gets its\\nown class and file and you have to figure out what to name it and\\nwhere to put it and even after 10 years of programming I don’t care\\nwhat anyone says, naming files and setting up code structure is the\\nhardest thing about programming</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Code is noisy, the html mixed with javascript is not something we\\nare use to seeing, and while its the real star behind React, it’s\\nmake the code get cluttered fast. Then, when you add Redux you start\\nmapping state to props and bind actions to the class, it’s just…\\nugly.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h4>Angular 2:</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Unit test are a nightmare because someone has a semi for dependency injection. It no jokes take 50 lines of code just to set up unit test for a single file. I still haven’t figured our how to test Services the Angular way.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>They encourage you to manipulate class variables being used in the view. This causes a lot of void function that simply mutate data instead if create function that take in data and return something new.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Deleting items from Observables. Observables are a bit mysterious, they are lightning fast array like data structures that can be updated repeatedly without from any where in the app. A bit like quantum entanglement. But they are unindexed and while you can add to them and magically update them they lack the ability to remove an item from the list. This last let people to do things with like cache the data in a service which they mutate and return as an Observable.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Finding current answers to questions… good luck. This is caused by a couple of things. A.) They change up so much from iteration to iteration and everything was a breaking change 2.) The name is basically the same as angular 1 while the frameworks couldn’t be more different. III.) The damn thing was in beta longer then its been out and 3 months after v2.0… here’s v4.0!!! WHAT! It’s just confusing.\\n** Oh yeah, and lets make 4 completely different ways create forms because we want people to have options but good luck because we are changing those too!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\\n<p>Do Angular the React way… (better put the Redux way)</p>\\n<p><strong>NgRx</strong> was the secret to this success. By extracting all your app state and data into a store, it makes writing your Angular a breeze. When we take that beautiful immutable idea and add in some functional concepts our code becomes neat and organized and easy to test.</p>\\n<h3>Before we go further, here are some simple rules I follow.</h3>\\n<h4>Rule 1:</h4>\\n<p>Externalize callbacks. Always call a functions for success/error of a promise or subscription, never do the function inside the .subscribe() or .then() like you will see in EVERY EXAMPLE</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nDoing this makes unit tests easier… much easier. Now, we don’t have to mock the return for .getData() or force it to resolve or anything. All we care about is that .getData was called. We can test returning anything we want in the setData() function. This also means we can create a test single object for each service that can be reused in all our specs.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>data<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>setData<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">setData</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h4>Rule 2:</h4>\\n<p>Don’t do things the TypeScript way. I would say just don’t use typescript but if you thought finding answers to questions was hard before, try finding answers in ES6. Write your TypeScript as if it was Javascript. Forget about creating types and models.</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nSure it makes your code safer but it certainly doesn’t make it cleaner. It also keeps your code closer to javascript so in 1–4 years when something better comes along (cough Vue, cough) You can reuse as much code as possible without the need to convert it from TypeScript to JavaScript. I think readability and reusability outweighs types safe pre transpiled code.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this 🤢</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">public</span> foo<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> IFoo <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Foo</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">public</span> bar<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> Foo\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">setBar</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>foo<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> Foo<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">void</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>bar <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> foo\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do This</span>\\nfoo <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Foo</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\nbar\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">setBar</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>foo<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>bar <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> foo\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// -- OR even --</span>\\nfoo <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Foo</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\nbar\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">setBar</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> foo <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>bar <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> foo\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h4>Rule 3:</h4>\\n<p>Always try to be declarative.

The core of the application is Gatsby, a static site generator built on React, with Bulma as the CSS framework.</p>\\n<p>It took me about <strong>5 days</strong>, including learning Gatsby, to get the site \\\"framed out\\\" and write the first post. Here are the steps in my learning process:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Learn Gatsby</strong>\\nFirst I need to do some tutorials, so my friend sent me a link to some YouTube videos he used to learn Gatsby.\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE\\\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I later realized he was doing three of the guides on the Gatsby website.

It took awhile to understand how the create pages stuff work on the gatsby-nodes file.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li><strong>Add in Bulma</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/\\\">https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I recently found Bulma while reading article about JavaScript 2017 Rising Stars <a href=\\\"https://risingstars.js.org/2017/en/#section-css-in-js\\\">https://risingstars.js.org/2017/en/#section-css-in-js</a></p>\\n<p>Since I hate bootstrap because EVERYONE uses it, I decided to give it a try, and so far I love it. I also LOVE Google Material but its starting to get a bit overused as well, plus its a bit too... fun... for the look I was going for.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li><strong>Navigation</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/\\\">https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>React makes things easy, try putting Bumla in Angular... good luck.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li><strong>Setup Medium Feed</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-medium/\\\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-medium/</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This step was a real headache. The current medium plugin does not work for users, only publications. I had to change three lines of code and copy it into my gatsby-node.js file to get it to work.</p>\\n<p>The guy that sits next to me at work has created a pull request to fix the plugin.

Lets see where the internet takes us. But let me very up front about something now…</p>\\n<p><strong>I AM NOT A WRITER</strong> … nor can my brain keep up with my fingers when I type, so this will be FULL of grammar errors and run on sentences. I know, I get it. I will try to do my best proof reading but I can’t promise anything. My tip to you is to just read everything with a Russian accent (which I don’t have) but that usually making things entertaining. Enjoy!</p>\\n<h2>Chapter One</h2>\\n<p>I have been doing Angular development for over 4 years and for the last 2 years I have been Angular 2/4/5/whatever (I will refer to it as Angular). But about a year ago I started to get into functional programming, and let me tell you, its changed my life about as much as finding Angular 1. But I learned quickly Angular, with its deeply ingrained object oriented designed, made doing things functional… well… difficult. Especially if you wanted to adhere to strict immutability. That’s when decided to look into the library everybody was raving about being the greatest think ever written… React!</p>\\n<p>At first, I thought this was the answer to all my problems, the solution to all my complaints. But I quickly realized that while yes it did address a lot of my complaints, it had its own set of equally frustrating issues. I built a few simple web pages, made an app using React Native, but at the end of the it found myself just as frustrated with React as I did with Angular. But I was determined because, and still feel this way, React is the better framework.</p>\\n<h3>The Problem(s)</h3>\\n<p>My top 3 of each but not limited to</p>\\n<h4>React:</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>SO MANY OPTIONS… seriously… There are so many libraries to choose\\nfrom I would spend time more looking at libraries then I would\\nbuilding.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Things get dirty fast, every tiny little thing gets its\\nown class and file and you have to figure out what to name it and\\nwhere to put it and even after 10 years of programming I don’t care\\nwhat anyone says, naming files and setting up code structure is the\\nhardest thing about programming</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Code is noisy, the html mixed with javascript is not something we\\nare use to seeing, and while its the real star behind React, it’s\\nmake the code get cluttered fast. Then, when you add Redux you start\\nmapping state to props and bind actions to the class, it’s just…\\nugly.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h4>Angular 2:</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Unit test are a nightmare because someone has a semi for dependency injection. It no jokes take 50 lines of code just to set up unit test for a single file. I still haven’t figured our how to test Services the Angular way.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>They encourage you to manipulate class variables being used in the view. This causes a lot of void function that simply mutate data instead if create function that take in data and return something new.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Deleting items from Observables. Observables are a bit mysterious, they are lightning fast array like data structures that can be updated repeatedly without from any where in the app. A bit like quantum entanglement. But they are unindexed and while you can add to them and magically update them they lack the ability to remove an item from the list. This last let people to do things with like cache the data in a service which they mutate and return as an Observable.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Finding current answers to questions… good luck. This is caused by a couple of things. A.) They change up so much from iteration to iteration and everything was a breaking change 2.) The name is basically the same as angular 1 while the frameworks couldn’t be more different. III.) The damn thing was in beta longer then its been out and 3 months after v2.0… here’s v4.0!!! WHAT! It’s just confusing.\\n** Oh yeah, and lets make 4 completely different ways create forms because we want people to have options but good luck because we are changing those too!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\\n<p>Do Angular the React way… (better put the Redux way)</p>\\n<p><strong>NgRx</strong> was the secret to this success. By extracting all your app state and data into a store, it makes writing your Angular a breeze. When we take that beautiful immutable idea and add in some functional concepts our code becomes neat and organized and easy to test.</p>\\n<h3>Before we go further, here are some simple rules I follow.</h3>\\n<h4>Rule 1:</h4>\\n<p>Externalize callbacks. Always call a functions for success/error of a promise or subscription, never do the function inside the .subscribe() or .then() like you will see in EVERY EXAMPLE</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nDoing this makes unit tests easier… much easier. Now, we don’t have to mock the return for .getData() or force it to resolve or anything. All we care about is that .getData was called. We can test returning anything we want in the setData() function. This also means we can create a test single object for each service that can be reused in all our specs.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>data<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> data\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getData</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>service<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getDate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>setData<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">setData</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h4>Rule 2:</h4>\\n<p>Don’t do things the TypeScript way. I would say just don’t use typescript but if you thought finding answers to questions was hard before, try finding answers in ES6. Write your TypeScript as if it was Javascript. Forget about creating types and models.</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nSure it makes your code safer but it certainly doesn’t make it cleaner. It also keeps your code closer to javascript so in 1–4 years when something better comes along (cough Vue, cough) You can reuse as much code as possible without the need to convert it from TypeScript to JavaScript.

Even using a library like Ramda or Lodash.</p>\\n<p><strong>-- Why --</strong>\\nDeclarative code abstracts the logic from your code, and instead makes code more descriptive and focuses on what the code is doing an less on how code is doing it.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do NOT do this</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">double</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> results <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">for</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span> arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>length<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    results<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">push</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>i<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> results\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Do This</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">double</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> arr <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> arr<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">map</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>item <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> item <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Seriously, thats it! ;)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>What’ Next…</h2>\\n<p>I still don’t see how this is doing Angular the React way…</p>\\n<p>Don’t worry, I’ll feed you baby bird.
